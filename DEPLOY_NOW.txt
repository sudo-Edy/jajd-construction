# 🚀 QUICK START - Railway Deployment

## The Problem (Already Fixed ✅)
- Railway showed 502 "Application failed to respond"
- Backend server wouldn't start in production
- `tsx` not available in production environment

## The Solution (Already Implemented ✅)
- ✅ Server now binds to 0.0.0.0:process.env.PORT
- ✅ Health endpoints return instant HTTP 200
- ✅ `tsx` moved to production dependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Email service is now optional

## Your Next Step (1 Thing)

### Option A: If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet
```bash
cd /Users/zeroday/Downloads/jajd-construction
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USER/jajd-construction.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: If you already have a remote set up
```bash
cd /Users/zeroday/Downloads/jajd-construction
git push
```

## After You Push (3 minutes)

1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Set these environment variables:**
   - RESEND_API_KEY = your actual key
   - EMAIL_FROM = noreply@yourdomain.com
   - RECEIVER_EMAIL = your-email@company.com
3. **Click Deploy**

## Railway Settings (Verify These)

**Build Command:** `npm ci`  
**Start Command:** `npx tsx backend/server.ts`

*(Do NOT use `npm run build` or `node dist/server.js`)*

## Test It Works

After Railway deploys, run this:
```bash
curl -i https://jajd-construction-production.up.railway.app/health
```

You should get:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
{"ok":true}
```

If you see 502, check Railway logs and let me know.

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**502 error on /health?**  
→ Check Railway Start Command is `npx tsx backend/server.ts`

**npm install fails?**  
→ Verify `tsx` is in `package.json` dependencies (it is ✅)

**Email not sending?**  
→ RESEND_API_KEY not set OR invalid. Set a real key in Railway.

**Server keeps crashing?**  
→ Check Railway logs for errors. Everything should work.
