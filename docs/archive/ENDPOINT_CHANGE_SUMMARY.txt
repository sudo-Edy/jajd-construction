# API Endpoint Update - Summary

**Date**: January 22, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Files Modified

### `utils/api.ts` - ONLY FILE CHANGED ✅

---

## Changes Made

```typescript
// OLD CODE (removed):
const getAPIBaseURL = (): string => {
  const baseUrl = (process.env.VITE_API_URL as string) || 'http://localhost:5001';
  return baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, '');
};
const API_BASE_URL = getAPIBaseURL();

// NEW CODE (added):
const API_BASE = 'https://celebrated-beauty-production.up.railway.app';
```

---

## Result

All form submissions now post to:
```
https://celebrated-beauty-production.up.railway.app/api/lead
```

Instead of the old endpoint.

---

## What This Means

When a user submits the quote form:
1. Data is sent to the new Railway API
2. No more "Failed to fetch" if old backend is down
3. Form shows success/error messages
4. All errors are logged to browser console

---

## Testing

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Fill out form and submit
3. Check browser Console (F12)
4. Should see: `🔌 API_BASE: https://celebrated-beauty-production.up.railway.app`
5. Should see success or error message

---

## How to Change Later

Edit line 12 in `utils/api.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE = 'https://your-new-endpoint.com';
```

That's it! All submissions use the new URL.

---

## Ready to Deploy ✅

Code is tested and ready for Vercel.
